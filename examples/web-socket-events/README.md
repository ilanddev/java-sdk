# Connect a web socket and process events
In this example app, we use the Java SDK to perform various operations:
* Login.
* Get a org uuid from the user's inventory
* Create a consumer and a filter for processing events.
* Connect a web socket with the consumer and filter and process events. 

[Here](https://github.com/ilanddev/java-sdk/wiki/Websocket-Event-processing) is a guide to help you understand the code and how it is working.
